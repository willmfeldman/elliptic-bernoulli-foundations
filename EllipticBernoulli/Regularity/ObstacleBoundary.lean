# Continuity of one-sided obstacle minimizers across `∂B`

`obstacle_below_continuousOn` (the obstacle problem of Abedin–Feldman–Stinson, Lemma 6.3, Step 1,
obstacle from above `0 ≤ w ≤ u`) and `obstacle_above_continuousOn` (Step 2, obstacle from below
`w ≥ u`). The proof of Lemma 6.3 uses the continuity of `w` on all of `U`, including across `∂B`;
Abedin–Feldman–Stinson do not prove it.

Proof. At `z ∈ ∂B` put `f = w` (Step 2) or `f = -w` (Step 1), `c = ±u(z)`, and let `L` be a
Lipschitz constant of `u` near `z`. For every small `ρ`, `f ∈ DG⁺` on `B_ρ(z)` at levels
`≥ c + Lρ` (`isDeGiorgiAt_above`, `isDeGiorgiAt_below`) and `f = ±u ≤ c + Lρ` on `B_ρ(z) \ B`.
Iterating `oscillation_decay` on the radii `ρ_i = R₀ 16^{-i}` (`ae_le_of_boundary`) gives
`f ≤ c + ε` a.e. near `z`; since `w` is continuous in `B` and equals `u` outside, this becomes a
pointwise one-sided bound, and the other side is the obstacle constraint.
