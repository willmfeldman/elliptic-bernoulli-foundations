# Build the standalone comparator workspaces from a fixed, reviewed list.
#
# Adapted from viscosity-solution-theory v0.2.0, scripts/build-challenges.sh.
#
# `--challenge-only` is appropriate before a Comparator release run: it never
# elaborates untrusted Solution.lean files. `--trusted-all` is for local
# development after the whole checkout is trusted.
#
# Environment:
#   LAKE         the lake command (default `lake`), e.g. a wrapper that
#                throttles concurrent builds.
#   FETCH_CACHE  set to 1 to run `lake exe cache get` at the root first (CI);
#                development checkouts clone the Mathlib build instead.

Usage: scripts/build-challenges.sh --challenge-only|--trusted-all

  --challenge-only  Build only the trusted Challenge target in every workspace.
  --trusted-all     Build Challenge and Solution explicitly in every workspace.

Use --challenge-only before an adversarial Comparator run.  --trusted-all is
only for a reviewed, trusted checkout.
